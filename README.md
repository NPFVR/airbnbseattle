## Installation<a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using the Seattle Airbnb Open Data to understand how hosts can boost the ratings of their Airbnbs.
Thereby I investigated
1. How skewed do guests rate their apartments on Airbnb?
2. What are the main factors influencing the rating?
3. What amenities are most likely to influence the rating?
## File Description<a name="files"></a>
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. The annotation in the cells guides through the thought process of each cell.
## Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@johannesgropper/this-is-how-youll-get-your-airbnb-s-rating-to-skyrocket-f8ae07b41dcd).
